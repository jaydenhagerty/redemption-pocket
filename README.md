# Redemption TCG Pocket
A Bible card collecting game inspired by Pok√©mon TCG Pocket.

This project aims to introduce Redemption card collecting to a broader audience. This means that some rarities and card price calculations are simplified compared to the actual game by [Cactus Game Design](https://www.cactusgamedesign.com/)

This repo contains all the source code and assets found in the game.
